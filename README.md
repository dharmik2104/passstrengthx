# 🔐 PassStrengthX

PassStrengthX is a powerful Python-based CLI tool that checks the **strength of a password** using entropy calculation and Dropbox's `zxcvbn` estimation. It also verifies whether the password has been exposed in known **data breaches** via the HaveIBeenPwned API — all using privacy-preserving techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Calculates password entropy in bits  
- 📊 Classifies password strength: Very Weak to Very Strong  
- 🔍 Checks if the password exists in public data breaches (using k-Anonymity)  
- 💻 Simple CLI usage — cross-platform  
- 🔒 Works offline except for breach checking

---

## 🛠 Usage

1. Clone the repo and enter the directory  
2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)  
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
4. Run:

```bash
python3 passstrengthx.py --password "YourPasswordHere"

Example:
python3 passstrengthx.py --password "Cyber@Dharmik2025"

🔐 Checking password: Cyber@Dharmik2025

🧠 Entropy: 111.43 bits  
📊 Strength: 🟦 Very strong  
✅ Not found in known breaches.
